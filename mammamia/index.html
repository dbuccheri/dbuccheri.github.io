	<h1 class="fancy gold"><span>What makes us different?</span></h1>
	
	
	
		<div id="singleCol"><p class="il"> <firstletter>W</firstletter>ith an almost infinite number of photo booth rental companies out there to choose from, especially around the L.A. area, what separates one from another…and what makes the MammaMia! experience so different and special?<br><br>
			Here are some other reasons the MammaMia! Photo Booth experience stands on its own:</p>
			
		</div>

	<div id="container"> 
		
			<div id="cols"><h2>IT'S ALL ABOUT THE EMOTIONS</h2>
				<p>Your host, an Italian-born photography expert with an acting background to his credit, and his staff bring fun, friendly and overtly outgoing personalities to every event, engaging guests so they get comfortable in the booth while bringing out their inner “bombshells.”</p>
			</div>
			<div id="cols">
				<h2>EASY, FUN, MODERN, WIRELESS</h2>
				<p>Touchscreen technology inside our booth enables guests to take pictures, animated GIFs, boomerang/regular videos, all while allowing them to print picture strips and send the pics/videos immediately to their email and phones. With social media exploding in popularity over the past few years, the wireless wonder of the MammaMia! Photo Booth also allows guests the opportunity to instantaneously share their fun times on their favorite social media platform. </p></div>
			<div id="cols"><h2>STYLISH COMPACT DESIGN</h2><p>
				The MammaMia! Photo Booth is Unique and boasts a compact, easy-to-move frame and was custom-created by a French designer to our exact specifications. Not only will its aesthetic wow and capture the attention of your guests, it will fully complement and adapt to your event’s environment. What’s more, the use of continuous lighting means party-goers won’t be annoyed by those typical continuous flashes many other booths use.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="cols">
				<h2>POWERFUL MARKETING TOOL</h2>
				<p>Unlike many other photo booths, the MammaMia! Photo Booth is capable of collecting emails and phone numbers from clients having their picture taken (with guest consent, of course), and we can even create custom surveys with open and closed answers. How exactly is this quite the powerful marketing tool? This list, encompassing all the collected data and responses, can be exported and processed for any marketing purpose you see fit.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="cols">
				<h2>THE SOCIAL EXPERIENCE FACTOR</h2>
				<p>You will be ecstatic when you see how your guests interact with the photo booth, whether it’s wearing pieces from outrageous costumes and props or striking hysterical poses. To call this an amazing “social tool” is something of an understatement, as guests who never met one another begin interacting and engaging in a fun-fueled time together.
				Our booth runs all night on unique batteries, which means no dangerous cables will get under your guests’ stiletto-clad feet.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="cols">
				<h2>QUALITY BACKDROPS &amp; PROPS</h2>
				<p>Our formidable selection of eye-catching backdrops and outrageous costumes/props is what we pride ourselves on, enabling all your participating guests to slip into that “second skin” and act as reserved or wild as they choose. We can also customize the backdrops and props to match the theme of your party or print a company logo on them in various formats.</p>
